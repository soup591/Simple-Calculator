# A Simple Calculator
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple calculator program using Python 3 to handle very basic mathematical functions based on user input. 

Additionally, I am using this program to become more familiar with the Github flow, and practice my Python skills as I work my way down the self-taught path. I hope that other very new programmers will find this useful as well.
